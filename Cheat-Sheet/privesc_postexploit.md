			* Abstract. Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system — an access to one memory ad- dress should not have unintended side e ects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more diffcult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row’s wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling e ects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing plat- form. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining var- ious potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors.

It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases). It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files).

				* There's many ways of getting the TI token other than these 3 techniques. For example as Vincent Yiu pointed out on Twitter if you've got easy access to a system token, say using Metasploit's getsystem command you can impersonate system and then open the TI token, it's just IMO less easy :-). If you get a system token with SeTcbPrivilege you can also call LogonUserExExW or LsaLogonUser where you can specify an set of additional groups to apply to a service token. Finally if you get a system token with SeCreateTokenPrivilege (say from LSASS.exe if it's not running PPL) you can craft an arbitrary token using the NtCreateToken system call.

			* [Social Engineering The Windows Kernel: Finding And Exploiting Token Handling Vulnerabilities - James Forshaw - BHUSA2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRpfvmMbDMg)
				* One successful technique in social engineering is pretending to be someone or something you're not and hoping the security guard who's forgotten their reading glasses doesn't look too closely at your fake ID. Of course there's no hyperopic guard in the Windows OS, but we do have an ID card, the Access Token which proves our identity to the system and let's us access secured resources. The Windows kernel provides simple capabilities to identify fake Access Tokens, but sometimes the kernel or other kernel-mode drivers are too busy to use them correctly. If a fake token isn't spotted during a privileged operation local elevation of privilege or information disclosure vulnerabilities can be the result. This could allow an attacker to break out of an application sandbox, elevate to administrator privileges, or even compromise the kernel itself. This presentation is about finding and then exploiting the incorrect handling of tokens in the Windows kernel as well as first and third party drivers. Examples of serious vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2015-0002 and CVE-2015-0062 will be presented. It will provide clear exploitable patterns so that you can do your own security reviews for these issues. Finally, I'll discuss some of the ways of exploiting these types of vulnerabilities to elevate local privileges.

The win32k.sys driver is a major component of the GUI subsystem in the Windows operating system. These vulnerabilities have been reported by the author and patched in MS08-025. The first vulnerability is a kernel pool overflow with an old communication mechanism called the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. The second vulnerability involves improper use of the ProbeForWrite function within string management functions. The third vulnerability concerns how win32k handles system menu functions. Their discovery and exploitation are covered.

	* [Accessing the Windows API in PowerShell via internal .NET methods and reflection](http://www.exploit-monday.com/2012/05/accessing-native-windows-api-in.html)
		* It is possible to invoke Windows API function calls via internal .NET native method wrappers in PowerShell without requiring P/Invoke or C# compilation. How is this useful for an attacker? You can call any Windows API function (exported or non-exported) entirely in memory. For those familiar with Metasploit internals, think of this as an analogue to railgun.

		* Easily define in-memory enums, structs, and Win32 functions in PowerShell
* **Command and Control**
	* [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)
		* Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent. It is the merge of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at BSidesLV in 2015 and Python EmPyre premeiered at HackMiami 2016.
	* [Koadic](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic)
		* Koadic, or COM Command & Control, is a Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other penetration testing tools such as Meterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does most of its operations using Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.

	* [LDAPDomainDump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump)
		* In an Active Directory domain, a lot of interesting information can be retrieved via LDAP by any authenticated user (or machine). This makes LDAP an interesting protocol for gathering information in the recon phase of a pentest of an internal network. A problem is that data from LDAP often is not available in an easy to read format. ldapdomaindump is a tool which aims to solve this problem, by collecting and parsing information available via LDAP and outputting it in a human readable HTML format, as well as machine readable json and csv/tsv/greppable files.
	* [ACLight](https://github.com/cyberark/ACLight)
		* The tool queries the Active Directory (AD) for its objects' ACLs and then filters and analyzes the sensitive permissions of each one. The result is a list of domain privileged accounts in the network (from the advanced ACLs perspective of the AD). You can run the scan with just any regular user (could be non-privileged user) and it automatically scans all the domains of the scanned network forest.
	* [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper)
		* MailSniper is a penetration testing tool for searching through email in a Microsoft Exchange environment for specific terms (passwords, insider intel, network architecture information, etc.). It can be used as a non-administrative user to search their own email, or by an Exchange administrator to search the mailboxes of every user in a domain. MailSniper also includes additional modules for password spraying, enumerating users/domains, gathering the Global Address List from OWA and EWS, and checking mailbox permissions for every Exchange user at an organization.

	* [Grouper](https://github.com/l0ss/Grouper)
		* Grouper is a slightly wobbly PowerShell module designed for pentesters and redteamers (although probably also useful for sysadmins) which sifts through the (usually very noisy) XML output from the Get-GPOReport cmdlet (part of Microsoft's Group Policy module) and identifies all the settings defined in Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that might prove useful to someone trying to do something fun/evil.

		* nullinux is an internal penetration testing tool for Linux that can be used to enumerate OS information, domain information, shares, directories, and users through SMB. If no username and password are provided, nullinux will attempt to connect to the target using an SMB null session. Unlike many of the enumeration tools out there already, nullinux can enumerate multiple targets at once and when finished, creates a users.txt file of all users found on the host(s). This file is formatted for direct implementation and further exploitation.This program assumes Python 2.7, and the smbclient package is installed on the machine. Run the setup.sh script to check if these packages are installed.

By reverse engineering (and abusing) some of these seemingly benign APIs, we can effectively manipulate Windows into performing stealthy custom attacks using previously unknown persistent and injection techniques. In this talk, we’ll get Windows to play with itself nonstop while revealing 0day persistence, previously unknown DLL injection techniques, and Windows API tips and tricks. To top it all off, a custom HTTP beaconing backdoor will be released leveraging the newly released persistence and injection techniques. So much Windows abuse, so little time.

		* Orchestrating BloodHound and Empire for Automated AD Post-Exploitation. Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation are two of the main steps in the Active Directory attacker kill- chain. Applying the 'assume breach' mentality, more and more companies are asking for red-teaming type of assessments, and security researcher have therefor developed a wide range of open-source tools to assist them during these engagements. Out of these, two have quickly gained a solid reputation: PowerShell Empire and BloodHound (Both by @Harmj0y & ex-ATD Crew). In this Session, I will be presenting DogStrike, a new tool (PowerShell Modules) made to interface Empire & BloodHound, allowing penetration testers to merge their Empire infrastructure into the bloodhound graph database. Doing so allows the operator to request a bloodhound path that is 'Agent Aware', and makes it possible to automate the entire kill chain, from initial foothold to DA - or any desired part of an attacker's routine. Presentation will be demo-driven. Code for the module will be made public after the presentation. Automation of Active Directory post-exploitation is going to happen sooner than you might think. (Other tools are being released with the same goal). Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? If I do not run out of time, I would like to finish the presentation by opening the discussion with the audience and see what the consequences of automated post- exploitation could mean, from the red, the blue or any other point of view... : DeathStar by @Byt3Bl33d3r | GoFetch by @TalTheMaor.

		* Keyloggers are a prominent class of malware that harvests sensitive data by recording any typed in information. Key- logger implementations strive to hide their presence using rootkit-like techniques to evade detection by antivirus and other system protections. In this paper, we present a new approach for implementing a stealthy keylogger: we explore the possibility of leveraging the graphics card as an alterna- tive environment for hosting the operation of a keylogger. The key idea behind our approach is to monitor the system’s keyboard buffer directly from the GPU via DMA, without any hooks or modifications in the kernel’s code and data structures besides the page table. The evaluation of our pro- totype implementation shows that a GPU-based keylogger can effectively record all user keystrokes, store them in the memory space of the GPU, and even analyze the recorded data in-place, with negligible runtime overhead.

The way it works is by injecting shellcode into memory, then wrapping a port spawned (meterpeter in this case) by the shellcode over SSH back to the attackers machine. Then connecting with meterpreter's listener to localhost will communicate through the SSH proxy, to the victim through the SSH tunnel. All communications are relayed through the SSH tunnel and not through the network.
		* **Sockets/TCP/UDP**
			* [shootback](https://github.com/aploium/shootback)
				* shootback is a reverse TCP tunnel let you access target behind NAT or firewall
			* [ssf - Secure Socket Funneling](https://github.com/securesocketfunneling/ssf)
				* Network tool and toolkit. It provides simple and efficient ways to forward data from multiple sockets (TCP or UDP) through a single secure TLS tunnel to a remote computer. SSF is cross platform (Windows, Linux, OSX) and comes as standalone executables.
			* [PowerCat](https://github.com/secabstraction/PowerCat)
				* A PowerShell TCP/IP swiss army knife that works with Netcat & Ncat
			* [Udp2raw-tunnel](https://github.com/wangyu-/udp2raw-tunnel)
				* A Tunnel which tunnels UDP via FakeTCP/UDP/ICMP Traffic by using Raw Socket, helps you Bypass UDP FireWalls(or Unstable UDP Environment). Its Encrypted, Anti-Replay and Multiplexed. It also acts as a Connection Stabilizer.)
			* [reGeorg](https://github.com/sensepost/reGeorg)

		* The shortcomings of anti-virus (AV) solutions have been well known for some time. Nevertheless, both public and private organizations continue to rely on AV software as a critical component of their information security programs, acting as a key protection mechanism over endpoints and other information systems within their networks. As a result, the security posture of these organizations is significantly jeopardized by relying only on this weakened control.

		* As a co-founder and principal developer of the Veil-Framework, the speaker has spent a considerable amount of time over the past year and a half researching AV-evasion techniques. This talk will briefly cover the problem space of antivirus detection, as well as the reaction to the initial release of Veil-Evasion, a tool for generating AV-evading executables that implements much of the speaker’s research. We will trace through the evolution of the obfuscation techniques utilized by Veil-Evasion’s generation methods, culminating in the release of an entirely new payload language class, as well as the release of a new ..NET encryptor. The talk will conclude with some basic static analysis of several Veil-Evasion payload families, showing once and for all that antivirus static signature detection is dead.

		* A funny thing happened when I evaluated several EDR, ETDR and Next Gen AV products, currently all the rage and latest must have security solution. Surprisingly to me the solutions kinda sucked at things we expected them to do or be better at, thus this talk so you can learn from our efforts. While testing, flaws were discovered and shared with the vendors, some of the flaws, bugs, or vulns that were discovered will be discussed. This talk takes a look at what we initially expected the solutions to provide us, the options or categories of what these solutions address, what to consider when doing an evaluation, how to go about testing these solutions, how they would fit into our process, and what we found while testing these solutions. What enraged me about these EDR solutions were how they were all over the place in how they worked, how hard or ease of use of the solutions, and the fact I found malware that did not trigger an alert on every solution I tested. And this is the next new bright and shiny blinky security savior solution? The news is not all bad, there is hope if you do some work to understand what these solutions target and provide, what to look for, and most importantly how to test them! What we never anticipated or expected is the tool we used to compare the tests and how well it worked and how it can help you.

			* In this article I am going to describe a way to execute code in windows kernel by using windbg local kernel debugging. It’s not a vulnerability, I am going to use only windbg’s legal functionality, and I am going to use only a batch file (not powershell, or vbs, an old style batch only) and some Microsoft’s signed executables (some of them that are already in the system and windbg, that we will be dumped from the batch file). With this method it is not necessary to launch executables at user mode (only Microsoft signed executables) or load signed drivers. PatchGuard and other protections don’t stop us. We put our code directly into kernel memory space and we hook some point to get a thread executing it. As we will demonstrate, a malware consisting of a simple batch file would be able to jump to kernel, enabling local kernel debugging and using windbg to get its code being executed in kernel.

			* Imagine being attacked by legitimate software tools that cannot be detected by usual defender tools. How bad could it be to be attacked by malicious threat actors only sending bytes to be read and bytes to be written in order to achieve advanced attacks? The most dangerous threat is the one you can’t see. At a time when it is not obvious to detect memory attacks using API like VirtualAlloc, what would be worse than having to detect something like `f0xffffe0010c79ebe8+0x8 L4 0xe8 0xcb 0x04 0x10`? We will be able to demonstrate that we can achieve every kind of attacks you can imagine using only PowerShell and a Microsoft Signed Debugger. We can retrieve passwords from the userland memory, execute shellcode by dynamically parsing loaded PE or attack the kernel achieving advanced persistence inside any system.

		* Description: In this talk we’ll do an architectural decomposition of application sandboxing technology from a security perspective. We look at various popular sandboxes such as Google Chrome, Adobe ReaderX, Sandboxie amongst others and discuss the limitations of each technology and it’s implementation. Further, we discuss in depth with live exploits how to break out of each category of sandbox by leveraging various kernel and user mode exploits – something that future malware could leverage. Some of these exploit vectors have not been discussed widely and awareness is important.

* **Generation**
	* [How to use msfvenom](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-to-use-msfvenom)
	* [msfpc](https://github.com/g0tmi1k/mpc)
		* A quick way to generate various "basic" Meterpreter payloads via msfvenom (part of the Metasploit framework).
	* [MorphAES](https://github.com/cryptolok/MorphAES)
		* MorphAES is the world's first polymorphic shellcode engine, with metamorphic properties and capability to bypass sandboxes, which makes it undetectable for an IDPS, it's cross-platform as well and library-independent.
	* [SharpShooter](https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/SharpShooter)
		* SharpShooter is a payload creation framework for the retrieval and execution of arbitrary CSharp source code. SharpShooter is capable of creating payloads in a variety of formats, including HTA, JS, VBS and WSF. It leverages James Forshaw's DotNetToJavaScript tool to invoke methods from the SharpShooter DotNet serialised object. Payloads can be retrieved using Web or DNS delivery or both; SharpShooter is compatible with the MDSec ActiveBreach PowerDNS project. Alternatively, stageless payloads with embedded shellcode execution can also be generated for the same scripting formats.
* **Go**
	* [Hershell](https://github.com/sysdream/hershell)	
		* Simple TCP reverse shell written in Go. It uses TLS to secure the communications, and provide a certificate public key fingerprint pinning feature, preventing from traffic interception.

* **HTA** 
	* [genHTA](https://github.com/vysec/GenHTA)
		* Generates anti-sandbox analysis HTA files without payloads
	* [morpHTA](https://github.com/vysec/MorphHTA)
		* Morphing Cobalt Strike's evil.HTA 
	* [Demiguise](https://github.com/nccgroup/demiguise)
		* The aim of this project is to generate .html files that contain an encrypted HTA file. The idea is that when your target visits the page, the key is fetched and the HTA is decrypted dynamically within the browser and pushed directly to the user. This is an evasion technique to get round content / file-type inspection implemented by some security-appliances. This tool is not designed to create awesome HTA content. There are many other tools/techniques that can help you with that. What it might help you with is getting your HTA into an environment in the first place, and (if you use environmental keying) to avoid it being sandboxed.
* **Keying**
	* [GoGreen](https://github.com/leoloobeek/GoGreen)
		* This project was created to bring environmental (and HTTP) keying to scripting languages. As its common place to use PowerShell/JScript/VBScript as an initial vector of code execution, as a result of phishing or lateral movement, I see value of the techniques for these languages.
* **LNK Files**
	* [LNKUp](https://github.com/Plazmaz/LNKUp)
		* Generates malicious LNK file payloads for data exfiltration
	* [Embedding reverse shell in .lnk file or Old horse attacks](http://onready.me/old_horse_attacks.html)

		* Tool for crafting msi binaries
* **.NET**
	* [DotNetToJScript](https://github.com/tyranid/DotNetToJScript)
		* A tool to create a JScript file which loads a .NET v2 assembly from memory.
	* [Payload Generation with CACTUSTORCH](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2017/07/payload-generation-with-cactustorch/)
		* [Code](https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/CACTUSTORCH)
* **Powershell**
	* [Invoke-PSImage](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-PSImage)
		* Invoke-PSImage takes a PowerShell script and embeds the bytes of the script into the pixels of a PNG image. It generates a oneliner for executing either from a file of from the web (when the -Web flag is passed). The least significant 4 bits of 2 color values in each pixel are used to hold the payload. Image quality will suffer as a result, but it still looks decent. The image is saved as a PNG, and can be losslessly compressed without affecting the ability to execute the payload as the data is stored in the colors themselves. It can accept most image types as input, but output will always be a PNG because it needs to be lossless. Each pixel of the image is used to hold one byte of script, so you will need an image with at least as many pixels as bytes in your script. This is fairly easy—for example, Invoke-Mimikatz fits into a 1920x1200 image.
* **Python**
	* [Pupy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)
		* Pupy is a remote administration tool with an embeded Python interpreter, allowing its modules to load python packages from memory and transparently access remote python objects. The payload is a reflective DLL and leaves no trace on disk
	* [Winpayloads](https://github.com/nccgroup/Winpayloads)
		* Undetectable Windows Payload Generation with extras Running on Python2.7
	* [Cloak](https://github.com/UltimateHackers/Cloak)
		* Cloak generates a python payload via msfvenom and then intelligently injects it into the python script you specify.

		* Kerberos- besides having three heads and guarding the gates of hell- protects services on Microsoft Windows Domains. Its use is increasing due to the growing number of attacks targeting NTLM authentication. Attacking Kerberos to access Windows resources represents the next generation of attacks on Windows authentication.In this talk Tim will discuss his research on new attacks against Kerberos- including a way to attack the credentials of a remote service without sending traffic to the service as well as rewriting tickets to access systems.He will also examine potential countermeasures against Kerberos attacks with suggestions for mitigating the most common weaknesses in Windows Kerberos deployments.
	* [Et tu - Kerberos?](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon4/t109-et-tu-kerberos-christopher-campbell)
		* For over a decade we have been told that Kerberos is the answer to Microsoft’s authentication woes and now we know that isn’t the case. The problems with LM and NTLM are widely known- but the problems with Kerberos have only recently surfaced. In this talk we will look back at previous failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket- Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately- we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

For reference, you can see this effect at 0:35 in this movie clip.r efficiency, speed and modern application deployment, amid questionable security. Recent advancements of the Linux kernel have coalesced for simple yet powerful OS virtualisation via Linux Containers, as implemented by LXC, Docker, and CoreOS Rkt among others. Recent container focused start-ups such as Docker have helped push containers into the limelight. Linux containers offer native OS virtualisation, segmented by kernel namespaces, limited through process cgroups and restricted through reduced root capabilities, Mandatory Access Control and user namespaces. This paper discusses these container features, as well as exploring various security mechanisms. Also included is an examination of attack surfaces, threats, and related hardening features in order to properly evaluate container security. Finally, this paper contrasts different container defaults and enumerates strong security recommendations to counter deployment weaknesses-- helping support and explain methods for building high-security Linux containers. Are Linux containers the future or merely a fad or fantasy? This paper attempts to answer that question.

* [Adapting Software Fault Isolation to Contemporary CPU Architectures](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/35649.pdf)
	* Adapting Software Fault Isolation to Contemporary CPU ArchitecturesSoftware Fault Isolation (SFI) is an effective approach to sandboxing binary code of questionable provenance, an interesting use case for native plugins in a Web browser. We present software fault isolation schemes for ARM and x86-64 that provide control-flow and memory integrity with average performance overhead of under 5% on ARM and 7% on x86-64. We believe these are the best known SFI implementations for these architectures, with significantly lower overhead than previous systems for similar architectures. Our experience suggests that these SFI implementations benefit from instruction-level parallelism, and have particularly small impact for work- loads that are data memory-bound, both properties that tend to reduce the impact of our SFI systems for future CPU implementations.](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/35649.pdf)
