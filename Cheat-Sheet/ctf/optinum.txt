Dont have full privileges. Use use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester to get recommendations

recommended by exploit suggester : exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
EDIT: doesnt work... sniff. We dont belong to admins.



After research found this: ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc

! DOESNT WORK - research further duh. !

!It does! Make sure the shell is same architecture as the os.
E.g the hfs exploit uses x86 by default while the machine was x64!
background the session, use the exploit with x64 (target 1) and run it


?
Also works for exploit: exploit/windows/local/ps_wmi_exec
            exploit/windows/local/applocker_bypass
?
