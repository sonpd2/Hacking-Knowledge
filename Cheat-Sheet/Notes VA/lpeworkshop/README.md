# Windows / Linux Local Privilege Escalation Workshop

My give back to the community initiative that was presented for free at several private and public events across Australia:

* Sydney - PlatypusCon (2017)
* Perth - BsidesPerth (2017)
* Brisbane - CrikeyCon (2018)

The workshop is based on the attack tree below, which covers all known (at the time) attack vectors of local user privilege escalation on both Linux and Windows operating systems.
