Wireless Penetration

    Wireless Assessment. The following information should ideally be obtained/enumerated when carrying out your wireless assessment. All this information is needed to give the tester, (and hence, the customer), a clear and concise picture of the network you are assessing. A brief overview of the network during a pre-site meeting weith the customer should allow you to estimate the timescales required to carry the assessment out.
